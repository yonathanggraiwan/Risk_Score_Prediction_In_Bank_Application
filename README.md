## Problem Background
`I am a data scientist working at a financial institution, namely Bank Hebat. A manager has asked me to develop a risk score prediction model for individuals applying for loans at Bank Hebat. The goal is to identify which features or variables influence a person’s risk score when applying for credit, and to process these variables to build a high-performing model that achieves high accuracy and low error rates in predicting the score. This risk score is needed when the bank wants to assess whether a customer poses a high risk in repaying or settling their loan.`

## Project Output
`The output of my project this time is best model to predict customer risk score (with regression, predict loan status approval (with classification), and present the result using huggingface website.`

## Data
The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lorenzozoppelletto/financial-risk-for-loan-approval/data). It contains customer financial informations, with 20,000 rows and 36 columns. The dataset is considered clean, with no duplicate entries or missing values.

## Method
`In this moment, I compare five machine learning algorithms to predict an individual's RiskScore: KNN Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, SVM Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated based on their error score (MAE) and R² score, obtained through 5-fold Cross Validation for each algorithm. The best-performing algorithm will be further refined using hyperparameter tuning, after which the model will be saved and deployed on Hugging Face for inference and user access.`

## Stacks
`The programming language used in this project is Python, with VSCode as the development tool. The libraries used include pandas, scipy, statistics, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express, sklearn, and xgboost. Data visualization is also presented in EDA section and huggingface website.`
