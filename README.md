## Problem Background
`I am a data analyst working in a department store. On this occasion, the store owner has asked me to analyze the annual sales data from their stores. I need to generate accurate analytical insights using statistics and create a visualization dashboard to answer key questions from the store executives.`

## Project Output
`The output of my project this time is best model to predict customer risk score (with regression, predict loan status approval (with classification), and present the result using huggingface website.`

## Data
`The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lorenzozoppelletto/financial-risk-for-loan-approval/data). It contains customer financial informations, with 20,000 rows and 36 columns. The dataset is considered clean, with no duplicate entries or missing values.
`

## Method
`In this moment, I compare five machine learning algorithms to predict an individual's RiskScore: KNN Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, SVM Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated based on their error score (MAE) and RÂ² score, obtained through 5-fold Cross Validation for each algorithm. The best-performing algorithm will be further refined using hyperparameter tuning, after which the model will be saved and deployed on Hugging Face for inference and user access.`

## Stacks
`The programming language used in this project is Python, with VSCode as the development tool. The libraries used include pandas, scipy, statistics, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express, sklearn, and xgboost. Data visualization is also presented in EDA section and huggingface website.`
